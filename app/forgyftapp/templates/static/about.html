    <p>This is just a brief description of what we do at Forgift.</p>
	<p>Based in Seattle, Washington, Forgift started with a team of four individuals with a goal of revolutionizing the gift-giving industry. By doing problem and solution validation interviews, the team learned that there was an obvious unique gift drought that the world was experiencing. There were too many generic gifts going around that exemplified a lack of care in the gift buying process. Too many people were buying last minute, simple gifts. After noticing this problem, the team created Forgift on October 10th, 2018. Forgift uses your prior knowledge on the receiver of the gift to create the perfect gift for them. Not only does Forgift take away the necessity for generic gifts like gift cards, but it also reminds you of when the party/event is and when you should buy your gift. The Forgift team is extremely passionate about creating an easier process for consumers so that they can quickly produce an affordable gift idea while their friend or relative can get the best gift ever on any special occasion. The Forgift team cares about all of your special days. Use Forgift to create the gift theyâ€™ll never forget!</p>
